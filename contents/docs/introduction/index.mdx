## LangChain

**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

**LangChain** simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:

- **Development**: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source components and third-party integrations. Use LangGraph to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.
- **Productionization**: Use LangSmith to inspect, monitor and evaluate your applications, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.
- **Deployment**: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with LangGraph Platform.

## Why LangChain?

The goal of the langchain package and LangChain the company is to make it as easy possible for developers to build applications that reason.
While LangChain originally started as a single open source package, it has evolved into a company and a whole ecosystem. This page will talk about the
LangChain ecosystem as a whole. Most of the components within in the LangChain ecosystem can be used by themselves - so if you feel particularly drawn to
certain components but not others, that is totally fine! Pick and choose whichever components you like best.

## Key Features

There are several primary needs that LangChain aims to address:

| Feature                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Standardized component interfaces** | The growing number of models and related components for AI applications has resulted in a wide variety of different APIs that developers need to learn and use. This diversity can make it challenging for developers to switch between providers or combine components when building applications. LangChain exposes a standard interface for key components, making it easy to switch between providers.                                                                    |
| **Orchestration**                     | As applications become more complex, combining multiple components and models, there's a growing need to efficiently connect these elements into control flows that can accomplish diverse tasks. Orchestration is crucial for building such applications.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Observability and evaluation**      | As applications become more complex, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand what is happening within them. Furthermore, the pace of development can become rate-limited by the paradox of choice: for example, developers often wonder how to engineer their prompt or which LLM best balances accuracy, latency, and cost. Observability and evaluations can help developers monitor their applications and rapidly answer these types of questions with confidence |

## How to Use These Documents

You'll find the documentation's navigation bar on the left side of the screen. The pages are organized in a logical sequence, progressing from foundational
topics to more advanced concepts, allowing you to follow along step-by-step as you build your documentation. However, feel free to explore the content in
any order, selecting the sections most relevant to your use case.

On the right side of the screen, a table of contents provides easy navigation between sections of each page. For quick access to specific content, you can
use the search bar at the top or the search shortcut (`Ctrl+K` or `Cmd+K`).

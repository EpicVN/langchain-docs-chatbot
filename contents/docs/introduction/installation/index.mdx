To install and use LangChain, you need to have several prerequisites in place. Here's a list of all the essential pre-requisites
for setting up and working on this project.

## Prerequisites

<Step>
<StepItem title="LangChain is written in TypeScript and can be used in:">

- **Node.js** (ESM and CommonJS) - 18.x, 19.x, 20.x
- **Cloudflare Workers**
- **Vercel / Next.js** (Browser, Serverless and Edge functions)
- **Supabase Edge Functions**
- **Browser**
- **Deno**
- **Bun**

However, note that individual integrations may not be supported in all environments.

</StepItem>
</Step>

## Installation

<Step>
<StepItem title="The main LangChain packages">
To install the main langchain package, run:

```bash
npm install langchain @langchain/core
```

While this package acts as a sane starting point to using LangChain, much of the value of LangChain comes when integrating it with various model providers, datastores, etc. By default, the dependencies needed to do that are NOT installed. You will need to install the dependencies for specific integrations separately. We'll show how to do that in the next sections of this guide.

Please also see the section on installing integration packages for some special considerations when installing LangChain packages.

</StepItem>

<StepItem title="How to install ecosystem packages">
With the exception of the langsmith SDK, all packages in the LangChain ecosystem depend on @langchain/core, which contains base classes and abstractions that other packages use. The dependency graph below shows how the difference packages are related. A directed arrow indicates that the source package depends on the target package:

<Note title="Note" type="danger">
  It is important that your app only uses one version of @langchain/core. Common
  package managers may introduce additional versions when resolving direct
  dependencies, even if you don't intend this. See this section on installing
  integration packages for more information and ways to remedy this.
</Note>

&nbsp;

<StepItem title="@langchain/community">

The **@langchain/community** package contains a range of third-party integrations. Install with:

```bash
npm install @langchain/community @langchain/core
```

There are also more granular packages containing LangChain integrations for individual providers.

</StepItem>

&nbsp;

<StepItem title="@langchain/core">

The **@langchain/core** package contains base abstractions that the rest of the LangChain ecosystem uses, along with the LangChain Expression Language. It should be installed separately:

```bash
npm install @langchain/core
```

</StepItem>

&nbsp;

<StepItem title="LangGraph">

**LangGraph.js** is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It integrates smoothly with LangChain, but can be used without it.

Install with:

```bash
npm install @langchain/langgraph @langchain/core
```

</StepItem>

&nbsp;

<StepItem title="LangSmith SDK">

The **LangSmith SDK** is automatically installed by LangChain. If you're not using it with LangChain, install with:

```bash
npm install langsmith
```

</StepItem>
</StepItem>

<StepItem title="Installing integration packages">
To install the main langchain package, run:

```bash
npm install langchain @langchain/core
```

LangChain supports packages that contain module integrations with individual third-party providers. They can be as specific as @langchain/anthropic, which contains integrations just for Anthropic models, or as broad as @langchain/community, which contains broader variety of community contributed integrations.

These packages, as well as the main LangChain package, all have @langchain/core as a peer dependency to avoid package managers installing multiple versions of the same package. It contains the base abstractions that these integration packages extend.

To ensure that all integrations and their types interact with each other properly, it is important that they all use the same version of @langchain/core. If you encounter type errors around base classes, you may need to guarantee that your package manager is resolving a single version of @langchain/core. To do so, you can add a "resolutions" or "overrides" field like the following in your project's package.json. The name will depend on your package manager:

<Note title="TIP" type="success">
  The **resolutions** or **pnpm.overrides** fields for **yarn** or **pnpm** must
  be set in the root **package.json** file.
</Note>

If you are using **yarn**:

<Note title="yarn package.json" type="note">
```bash
{
  "name": "your-project",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@langchain/anthropic": "^0.0.2",
    "@langchain/core": "^0.3.0",
    "langchain": "0.0.207"
  },
  "resolutions": {
    "@langchain/core": "0.3.0"
  }
}
```
</Note>

You can also try running the **yarn dedupe** command if you are on **yarn** version 2 or higher.

Or for **npm**:

<Note title="npm package.json" type="note">
```bash
{
  "name": "your-project",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@langchain/anthropic": "^0.0.2",
    "@langchain/core": "^0.3.0",
    "langchain": "0.0.207"
  },
  "overrides": {
    "@langchain/core": "0.3.0"
  }
}
```
</Note>

You can also try the **npm dedupe** command.

Or for **pnpm**:

<Note title="pnpm package.json" type="note">
```bash
{
  "name": "your-project",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@langchain/anthropic": "^0.0.2",
    "@langchain/core": "^0.3.0",
    "langchain": "0.0.207"
  },
  "pnpm": {
    "overrides": {
      "@langchain/core": "0.3.0"
    }
  }
}
```
</Note>

You can also try the **pnpm dedupe** command.

<StepItem title="Loading the library">
<StepItem title="TypeScript">

LangChain is written in TypeScript and provides type definitions for all of its public APIs.

</StepItem>

&nbsp;

<StepItem title="ESM">

LangChain provides an ESM build targeting Node.js environments. You can import it using the following syntax:

```bash
npm install @langchain/openai @langchain/core
```

<Note title="Import" type="note">
  ```bash import {ChatOpenAI} from "@langchain/openai"; ```
</Note>

If you are using TypeScript in an ESM project we suggest updating your tsconfig.json to include the following:

<Note title="tsconfig.json" type="note">
```bash
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "target": "ES2020", // or higher
    "module": "nodenext",
  }
}
```
</Note>

</StepItem>

&nbsp;

<StepItem title="CommonJS">
LangChain provides a CommonJS build targeting Node.js environments. You can import it using the following syntax:

<Note title="Import" type="note">
  ```bash 
  const {ChatOpenAI} = require("@langchain/openai"); 
  ```
</Note>
</StepItem>

&nbsp;

<StepItem title="Cloudflare Workers">
LangChain can be used in Cloudflare Workers. You can import it using the following syntax:

<Note title="Import" type="note">
  ```bash 
  import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
  ```
</Note>
</StepItem>

&nbsp;

<StepItem title="Vercel / Next.js">
LangChain can be used in Vercel / Next.js. We support using LangChain in frontend components, in Serverless functions and in Edge functions. You can import it using the following syntax:

<Note title="Import" type="note">
  ```bash 
  import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
  ```
</Note>
</StepItem>

&nbsp;

<StepItem title="Deno / Supabase Edge Functions">
LangChain can be used in Deno / Supabase Edge Functions. You can import it using the following syntax:

<Note title="Import" type="note">
  ```bash 
  import { ChatOpenAI } from "https://esm.sh/@langchain/openai";
  ```
</Note>

or

<Note title="Import" type="note">
  ```bash 
  import { ChatOpenAI } from "npm:@langchain/openai";
  ```
</Note>
</StepItem>

&nbsp;

<StepItem title="Browser">
LangChain can be used in the browser. In our CI we test bundling LangChain with Webpack and Vite, but other bundlers should work too. You can import it using the following syntax:

<Note title="Import" type="note">
  ```bash 
  import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
  ```
</Note>
</StepItem>

&nbsp;

<StepItem title="Unsupported: Node.js 16">
We do not support Node.js 16, but if you still want to run LangChain on Node.js 16, you will need to follow the instructions in this section. We do not guarantee that these instructions will continue to work in the future.

You will have to make fetch available globally, either:

  - run your application with **NODE_OPTIONS='--experimental-fetch' node ...**, or
  - install **node-fetch** and follow the instructions **here**
You'll also need to polyfill **ReadableStream** by installing:

```bash 
  npm i web-streams-polyfill@4
```

And then adding it to the global namespace in your main entrypoint:

<Note title="Import" type="note">
  ```bash 
  import "web-streams-polyfill/polyfill";
  ```
</Note>

Additionally you'll have to polyfill **structuredClone**, eg. by installing **core-js** and following the instructions **here**.

If you are running Node.js 18+, you do not need to do anything.

title: Build a Question Answering application over a Graph Database
description: In this guide we’ll go over the basic ways to create a Q&A chain over a graph database. These systems will allow us to ask a question about the data in a graph database and get back a natural language answer.
---

## Security note

Building Q&A systems of SQL databases requires executing model-generated SQL queries. There are inherent risks in doing this. Make sure that your database connection permissions are always scoped as narrowly as possible for your chain/agent’s needs. This will mitigate though not eliminate the risks of building a model-driven system. For more on general security best practices, [see here](/docs/security).

## Architecture

At a high-level, the steps of these systems are:

1. Convert question to SQL query: Model converts user input to a SQL query.
2. Execute SQL query: Execute the query.
3. Answer the question: Model responds to user input using the query results.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

    <TabsTrigger value="npm">npm</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="yarn">yarn</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="pnpm">pnpm</TabsTrigger>
    </TabsList>

    <TabsContent value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm i langchain @langchain/community @langchain/openai @langchain/core neo4j-driver
    ```
    </TabsContent>

    ```
    </TabsContent>

    <TabsContent value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add langchain @langchain/community @langchain/openai @langchain/core neo4j-driver
    ```
    </TabsContent>

</Tabs>

Set environment variables
We’ll use OpenAI in this example:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Optional, use LangSmith for best-in-class observability
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your-api-key
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true

# Reduce tracing latency if you are not in a serverless environment
# LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND=true
```

Next, we need to define Neo4j credentials. Follow [these installation](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/) steps to set up a Neo4j database.

```bash
NEO4J_URI="bolt://localhost:7687"
NEO4J_USERNAME="neo4j"
NEO4J_PASSWORD="password"
```

The below example will create a connection with a Neo4j database and will populate it with example data about movies and their actors.

```jsx {0} showLineNumbers
import "neo4j-driver";
import { Neo4jGraph } from "@langchain/community/graphs/neo4j_graph";

const url = process.env.NEO4J_URI;
const username = process.env.NEO4J_USER;
const password = process.env.NEO4J_PASSWORD;
const graph = await Neo4jGraph.initialize({ url, username, password });

// Import movie information
const moviesQuery = `LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 
'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomasonjo/blog-datasets/main/movies/movies_small.csv'
AS row
MERGE (m:Movie {id:row.movieId})
SET m.released = date(row.released),
    m.title = row.title,
    m.imdbRating = toFloat(row.imdbRating)
FOREACH (director in split(row.director, '|') | 
    MERGE (p:Person {name:trim(director)})
    MERGE (p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m))
FOREACH (actor in split(row.actors, '|') | 
    MERGE (p:Person {name:trim(actor)})
    MERGE (p)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m))
FOREACH (genre in split(row.genres, '|') | 
    MERGE (g:Genre {name:trim(genre)})
    MERGE (m)-[:IN_GENRE]->(g))`;

await graph.query(moviesQuery);
````

```bash
Schema refreshed successfully.
```

```bash
[]
```

## Graph schema

In order for an LLM to be able to generate a Cypher statement, it needs information about the graph schema. When you instantiate a graph object, it retrieves the information about the graph schema. If you later make any changes to the graph, you can run the **refreshSchema** method to refresh the schema information.

```jsx {0} showLineNumbers
await graph.refreshSchema();
console.log(graph.getSchema());
````

```bash
Node properties are the following:
Movie {imdbRating: FLOAT, id: STRING, released: DATE, title: STRING}, Person {name: STRING}, Genre {name: STRING}
Relationship properties are the following:

The relationships are the following:
(:Movie)-[:IN_GENRE]->(:Genre), (:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(:Movie), (:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(:Movie)
```

## Chain

Let’s use a simple chain that takes a question, turns it into a Cypher query, executes the query, and uses the result to answer the original question.

![graph_1](/images/graph_1.png "graph_1")

LangChain comes with a built-in chain for this workflow that is designed to work with Neo4j: **GraphCypherQAChain**.

<Note title="Danger" type="danger">
The **GraphCypherQAChain** used in this guide will execute Cypher statements against the provided database. For production, make sure that the database connection uses credentials that are narrowly-scoped to only include necessary permissions.

Failure to do so may result in data corruption or loss, since the calling code may attempt commands that would result in deletion, mutation of data if appropriately prompted or reading sensitive data if such data is present in the database.
</Note>

```jsx {0} showLineNumbers
import { GraphCypherQAChain } from "langchain/chains/graph_qa/cypher";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

const llm = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature: 0 });
const chain = GraphCypherQAChain.fromLLM({
  llm,
  graph,
});
const response = await chain.invoke({
  query: "What was the cast of the Casino?",
});
console.log(response);
````

```bash
{ result: "James Woods, Joe Pesci, Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone" }
```

title: Build a semantic search engine
description: This tutorial will familiarize you with LangChain’s document loader, embedding, and vector store abstractions. These abstractions are designed to support retrieval of data– from (vector) databases and other sources– for integration with LLM workflows. They are important for applications that fetch data to be reasoned over as part of model inference, as in the case of retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG (see our RAG tutorial here).

Here we will build a search engine over a PDF document. This will allow us to retrieve passages in the PDF that are similar to an input query.

## Concepts

This guide focuses on retrieval of text data. We will cover the following concepts:

    - Documents and document loaders;
    - Text splitters;
    - Embeddings;
    - Vector stores and retrievers.

## Setup

### Jupyter Notebook

This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebook. See here for instructions on how to install.

### Installation

This guide requires **@langchain/community** and **pdf-parse**:

<Tabs defaultValue="npm" className="pt-5 pb-1">
    <TabsList className="">
    <TabsTrigger value="npm">npm</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="yarn">yarn</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="pnpm">pnpm</TabsTrigger>
    </TabsList>

    <TabsContent value="npm">
    ```bash
    npm i @langchain/community pdf-parse
    ```
    </TabsContent>

    <TabsContent value="yarn">
    ```bash
    yarn add @langchain/community pdf-parse
    ```
    </TabsContent>

    <TabsContent value="pnpm">
    ```bash
    pnpm add @langchain/community pdf-parse
    ```
    </TabsContent>

</Tabs>

For more details, see our [Installation guide](/docs/introduction/installation).

### LangSmith

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls. As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent. The best way to do this is with LangSmith.

After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="..."

# Reduce tracing latency if you are not in a serverless environment
# export LANGCHAIN_CALLBACKS_BACKGROUND=true
```

## Documents and Document Loaders

LangChain implements a Document abstraction, which is intended to represent a unit of text and associated metadata. It has three attributes:

- **pageContent**: a string representing the content;
- **metadata**: records of arbitrary metadata;
- **id**: (optional) a string identifier for the document.

The **metadata** attribute can capture information about the source of the document, its relationship to other documents, and other information. Note that an individual Document object often represents a chunk of a larger document.

We can generate sample documents when desired:

```jsx {0} showLineNumbers
import { Document } from "@langchain/core/documents";

const documents = [
  new Document({
    pageContent:
      "Dogs are great companions, known for their loyalty and friendliness.",
    metadata: { source: "mammal-pets-doc" },
  }),
  new Document({
    pageContent: "Cats are independent pets that often enjoy their own space.",
    metadata: { source: "mammal-pets-doc" },
  }),
];
```

However, the LangChain ecosystem implements document loaders that integrate with hundreds of common sources. This makes it easy to incorporate data from these sources into your AI application.

### Loading documents

Let’s load a PDF into a sequence of Document objects. There is a sample PDF in the LangChain repo here – a 10-k filing for Nike from 2023. LangChain implements a PDFLoader that we can use to parse the PDF:

```jsx {0} showLineNumbers
import { PDFLoader } from "@langchain/community/document_loaders/fs/pdf";

const loader = new PDFLoader("../../data/nke-10k-2023.pdf");

const docs = await loader.load();
console.log(docs.length);
```

```bash
107
```

<Note title="TIP" type="success">
  See [this guide](/docs/how_to/document_loader_pdf) for more detail on PDF document loaders.
</Note>

**PDFLoader** loads one Document object per PDF page. For each, we can easily access:

- The string content of the page;
- Metadata containing the file name and page number.

```jsx {0} showLineNumbers
docs[0].pageContent.slice(0, 200);
```

```bash
Table of Contents
UNITED STATES
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Washington, D.C. 20549
FORM 10-K
(Mark One)
☑ ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
FO
```

```jsx {0} showLineNumbers
docs[0].metadata;
```

```bash
{
  source: '../../data/nke-10k-2023.pdf',
  pdf: {
    version: '1.10.100',
    info: {
      PDFFormatVersion: '1.4',
      IsAcroFormPresent: false,
      IsXFAPresent: false,
      Title: '0000320187-23-000039',

      Keywords: '0000320187-23-000039; ; 10-K',

      ModDate: "D:20230720162208-04'00'"
    },
    metadata: null,
    totalPages: 107
  },
  loc: { pageNumber: 1 }
}
```

### Splitting

For both information retrieval and downstream question-answering purposes, a page may be too coarse a representation. Our goal in the end will be to retrieve Document objects that answer an input query, and further splitting our PDF will help ensure that the meanings of relevant portions of the document are not “washed out” by surrounding text.

We can use text splitters for this purpose. Here we will use a simple text splitter that partitions based on characters. We will split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important context related to it. We use the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, which will recursively split the document using common separators like new lines until each chunk is the appropriate size. This is the recommended text splitter for generic text use cases.

We set **add_start_index=True** so that the character index where each split Document starts within the initial Document is preserved as metadata attribute “start_index”.

See [this guide](/docs/how_to/document_loader_pdf) for more detail about working with PDFs.

```jsx {0} showLineNumbers
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "@langchain/textsplitters";

const textSplitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
  chunkSize: 1000,
  chunkOverlap: 200,
});

const allSplits = await textSplitter.splitDocuments(docs);

allSplits.length;
```

```bash
513
```

## Embeddings

Vector search is a common way to store and search over unstructured data (such as unstructured text). The idea is to store numeric vectors that are associated with the text. Given a query, we can embed it as a vector of the same dimension and use vector similarity metrics (such as cosine similarity) to identify related text.

LangChain supports embeddings from dozens of providers. These models specify how text should be converted into a numeric vector. Let’s select a model.

Armed with a model for generating text embeddings, we can next store them in a special data structure that supports efficient similarity search.

## Vector stores

LangChain VectorStore objects contain methods for adding text and Document objects to the store, and querying them using various similarity metrics. They are often initialized with embedding models, which determine how text data is translated to numeric vectors.

LangChain includes a suite of integrations with different vector store technologies. Some vector stores are hosted by a provider (e.g., various cloud providers) and require specific credentials to use; some (such as Postgres) run in separate infrastructure that can be run locally or via a third-party; others can run in-memory for lightweight workloads.

Having instantiated our vector store, we can now index the documents.

```jsx {0} showLineNumbers
await vectorStore.addDocuments(allSplits);
````

Note that most vector store implementations will allow you to connect to an existing vector store– e.g., by providing a client, index name, or other information. See the documentation for a specific integration for more detail.

Once we’ve instantiated a **VectorStores** that contains documents, we can query it. VectorStore includes methods for querying: - Synchronously and asynchronously; - By string query and by vector; - With and without returning similarity scores; - By similarity and maximum marginal relevance (to balance similarity with query to diversity in retrieved results).

The methods will generally include a list of Document objects in their outputs.

### Usage

Embeddings typically represent text as a “dense” vector such that texts with similar meanings are gemoetrically close. This lets us retrieve relevant information just by passing in a question, without knowledge of any specific key-terms used in the document.

Return documents based on similarity to a string query:

```jsx {0} showLineNumbers
const results1 = await vectorStore.similaritySearch(
  "When was Nike incorporated?"
);

results1[0];
````

```bash
Document {
  pageContent: 'Table of Contents\n' +
    'PART I\n' +
    'ITEM 1. BUSINESS\n' +
    'GENERAL\n' +
    'NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 under the laws of the State of Oregon. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Annual Report"), the terms "we," "us," "our,"\n' +

    'the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations, which are comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores\n' +

      totalPages: 107
    },
    loc: { pageNumber: 4, lines: [Object] }
  },
  id: undefined
}
```

Return scores:

```jsx {0} showLineNumbers
const results2 = await vectorStore.similaritySearchWithScore(
  "What was Nike's revenue in 2023?"
);

results2[0];
````

## Retrievers

LangChain **VectorStore** objects do not subclass Runnable. LangChain Retrievers are Runnables, so they implement a standard set of methods (e.g., synchronous and asynchronous **invoke** and **batch** operations). Although we can construct retrievers from vector stores, retrievers can interface with non-vector store sources of data, as well (such as external APIs).

Vectorstores implement an as retriever method that will generate a Retriever, specifically a VectorStoreRetriever. These retrievers include specific **search_type** and **search_kwargs** attributes that identify what methods of the underlying vector store to call, and how to parameterize them.

```jsx {0} showLineNumbers
const retriever = vectorStore.asRetriever({
  searchType: "mmr",
  searchKwargs: {
    fetchK: 1,
  },
});

await retriever.batch([
  "When was Nike incorporated?",
  "What was Nike's revenue in 2023?",
]);
````

VectorStoreRetriever supports search types of "similarity" (default) and "mmr" (maximum marginal relevance, described above).

Retrievers can easily be incorporated into more complex applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications that combine a given question with retrieved context into a prompt for a LLM. To learn more about building such an application, check out the [**RAG tutorial**](/docs/tutorials/rag) tutorial.

Retrieval strategies can be rich and complex. For example:

- We can infer hard rules and filters from a query (e.g., “using documents published after 2020”);
- We can return documents that are linked to the retrieved context in some way (e.g., via some document taxonomy);
- We can generate multiple embeddings for each unit of context;
- We can ensemble results from multiple retrievers;
- We can assign weights to documents, e.g., to weigh recent documents higher.

The retrievers section of the how-to guides covers these and other built-in retrieval strategies.

It is also straightforward to extend the BaseRetriever class in order to implement custom retrievers. See our how-to guide here.
